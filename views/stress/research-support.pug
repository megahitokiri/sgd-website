             | Sequencing will be conducted by the Genome Sciences Centre (GSC) in Vancouver, which operates 13 Illumina HiSeq 2500 v4 and 3 MiSeq instruments
             strong .
             |  The GSC is one of Genome Canada&rsquo;s GIN nodes. Bioinformatics will be conducted at several locations. Our collaborators at SAP AG will provide access to their in-memory database (SAP HANA), as well as to the SAP Cloud, which will be useful for the processing and analyses of the very large genomic datasets to be generated by this project. Yeaman and Rieseberg&rsquo;s groups also have access to Westgrid, which offers high-performance computing to academic institutions in Western Canada, the UBC Biodiversity Centre&rsquo;s computing cluster, and to the large-scale and cost effective storage capacity offered by UBC&rsquo;s Botany department. This is in addition to significant computing power available in the investigator&rsquo;s own labs.

             | Phenotyping will be carried out at several locations, including UBC, Indian Head (SK), U. Georgia, USDA-Fargo, DREC, INRA, and NaSSARI. The required infrastructure for greenhouse/growth room phenotyping and ecophysiological characterization is available at UBC, U. Georgia, and INRA. High-throughput phenotyping capability exists at DREC (e.g. tractor-mounted sensor arrays) and INRA (the Heliaphen system). The critical infrastructure necessary to apply field-based HTP approaches is also present at USDA-Fargo and Indian Head, including GPS-RTK guided planters and small plot combines. Conventional phenotyping capability exists at NaSSARI, and the present project will introduce more automated phenotyping approaches to this location.
           p
             | Functional analyses will be performed in the laboratories of Burke, Rieseberg, and collaborator Parrott. All three labs are well-equipped for basic molecular analyses and both forward and reverse genetics approaches. Parrot and Rieseberg also maintain transformation and tissue culture labs.
